      <h1> Britney's Datastory </h1>
        <p> This single-page website is a reflection about the projects I did
          this semester in Dr. Lindgren’s Writing & Digital Media class. The
          four projects I completed were: Data Collection, Data Visualization,
          Explained Video and this DataStory Website. I will use my reflections
          from those projects to explain what I’ve learned about how data,
          information and ethical issues all relate to one another.
        </p>

        <p> For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been an analytical person.
          I am a very curious person and always need to get to the bottom of things. I
          went into this class not knowing that it would be the perfect fit for
          me. I really enjoyed how Dr. Lindgren incorporated data, information
          and ethical issues into a writing class. Hope you enjoy my datastory!

        <p> Datafication is a word that I’ve heard of before this class but
          I didn’t really know what it was. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datafication"
          target="_blank">Datafication </a> is the practice to collect and
          use people’s everyday digital media and technology habits. As Dr.
          Lindgren said in class, datafication is linked to issues of
          privacy, policy and commodification of people and their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before collecting data on ourselves and starting our Datastory jouney, Dr. Lindgren thought it was
          necessary for us to read articles surrounding ethical issues. The most
          basic definition of ethical issues is, a problem or situation that
          requires a person to choose between alternatives that must be
          evaluated as right or wrong. In the Beabout and Hannis reading,
          they mention how ethics is an art of character and it is something
          that a person just “has” based off their actions throughout their
          life. But not everyone follows the same ethical rules. When reading
          “Ethical Expediency: Classical Rhetoric, Technology and and the
          Holocaust” we see that the Nazi’s obviously did not have the same
          ethics as the most of the world. Katz brought up the term ‘ethics
          of expediency’ which he is referring to the convenience of
          something becomes more important than the ethical aspect of its
          purpose. In this document, he mentions how Hitler used the ethic
          of expediency rhetorically to create a moral justification for the
          Nazi actions. Ethical issues in research consists of ensuring the
          quality and integrity of what we are researching. Reviewing the
          terms ‘ethics’ and ‘ethics of expediency’ before collecting
          research on ourselves was important because it makes sure that we
          all follow the same ethical standards.

          <h1> Data Collection </h1>
            <p>
              In order to fully understand the concept of Datafication, Dr. Lindgren designed a
              project that challenged us to learn how digital media and data are
              intertwined. This involved collecting data on ourselves for 5-7
              days about our everyday digital habits. For my data collection, I
              decided to focus on the genre of music I listened to and how it
              affected my mood.  I wanted to evaluate my mood on a numerical scale
              so I created my own scale from 1-5 and named it Influence. When
              the genre of music made my mood change for the better, I would
              rate it a 5; alternatively, if my mood got worse because of the
              genre of music, I would give it a 1. If the genre of music had no effect on
              my mood, I would rate it a 3. Whenever I listened to music within
              those 5 days straight I would record: the genre of music, what I
              was doing at that moment, my mood before, my modo after ,who
              picked the music and the influence the music had on changing my
              mood.
            </p>
            <p>
              In quantitative research ethical standards prevents against fabrication or falsifying data.
              When doing our Data Collection project, we had to ensure we
              collected at least ten entries a day for five days. If for some
              reason we missed a day, we were able to continue to collect data
              throughout the weekend. It would’ve been easy to not collect data
               on ourselves but that wouldn’t have been very ethical of us.

          <h1> Data Visualization </h1>
            <p>
              In this graphic design project, I learned how to make sound design
              decisions and how to represent my data visually. I then learned
              how to draw SVGs in Inkscape, which is where I made the visial
              below.
            </p>
            <p> For the Data Visualization project I wanted my design to be
              something that would be easy for my auidence to interpret. After
              brainstorming some ideas, the best way I thought to show the data
              I collected was through a soundwave. Its a categorical chart with
              genre on the x-axis and the different lenghths on the soundwave
              depends on how much the genre influnced my change in mood (1-5).
              Copyleft resources are being able to modify other people’s work by
              still citing it. In our case we had the option to use SVG Icons.
              For my data visual, I decided just to use SVG icons for the title,
              music icons. I went to the <a href="https://thenounproject.com/" target="_blank">
              The Noun Project</a> and downloawded a SVG icon from there.

            <p> My group and I decided to do our Explained Video on
              Cryptocurrency. While doing this project, I researched and composed
              a video that explains a broader soical matter about how corporations
              and organization have developed lsiiting techniques worth of our
              critcal attention. Young (2017) referred to as listing techniques:
              how organizations write algorithms to collect and use data about
              peoples' ideas and lives. During the lab based classes Dr. Lindgren
              provided, I learned and applied video composition skills to create
              a short explanatroy video about the Data Collection practice with
              my group members.
